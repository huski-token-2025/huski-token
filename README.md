# 🐶 Huski Token: The Ultimate Meme Degen Playground

Huski Token is a **fun, chaotic, and experimental** meme token ecosystem built for **degens, by degens**. Packed with wild features like **stake shares**, a **mine-to-earn game**, a **lottery**, and a **degen chatroom**, Huski is a social playground where the only rule is to have fun — and maybe make it to Valhalla.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This project is extremely degen. Don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose. Just have fun.

## 🌟 Features

### 🧊 Stake Share

Stake your \$HUSKI tokens to earn share points and gain access to exclusive game modes, lotteries, and multipliers.

* Stake to earn.
* Unstake with penalties (because real degens diamond-hand).
* Share system influences your in-game yield and lottery odds.

### ⛏️ Mine Game

A playful mine-to-earn experience.

* Send your Huski into the mine.
* RNG-based outcomes: dig up more \$HUSKI, or come back empty-pawed.
* Risk vs reward mechanics: mine deeper, earn bigger… or lose it all.

### 🎰 Lottery

Weekly on-chain lottery system.

* Buy tickets with \$HUSKI.
* Jackpot sourced from penalties, mine tax, and staker cuts.
* Winners chosen randomly and transparently.

### 💬 Degen Chatroom

Built-in chat for maximum degen coordination.

* Live token price & lottery stats.
* Memes, alpha, trash talk — all welcome.
* Token-gated access for \$HUSKI holders.
